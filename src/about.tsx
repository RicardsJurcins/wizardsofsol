    let about = `The inspiration for this project was a project called Weird Whales on the Ethereum blockchain. Once I heard that a 12-year-old could make this happen, 
            I knew I wanted to try.I've always been entrepreneurial and my interest in crypto led me to the world of NFTs.I started this project 3 months ago with months worth of experience in the NFT 
            space. Through these 3 months, I've learned a lot about NFTs.At the start, I thought it's all about the art and the team.Although those things are important, 
            the most important aspect of any project is the community - You. Without a community, it's just a lonely picture with no demand. That is why I've decided to make this 
            project all about the community.You will decide the future of this project, I will only be the middle man.As this is my first project and You supporting my journey, 
            I will grant You a future airdrop of my projects to come.I know right now this may sound like a worthless offer, but You best believe that this will be something magical. 
            Follow my journey through the metaverse and as Warren Buffett once said, â€œThe best investment you can make, is an investment in yourself." and I stand by this quote.`;
